## Introduction

The Ashet Home Computer, or short just *Ashet* is a late 80ies style inspired [home computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_computer) with a 16 bit cpu.

Most components of *Ashet* are self-developed chips and computer components, like the *SPU Mark II* CPU, the yet unnamed MMU, video chip and blitter DMA.

## Goal of the project

Create a home computer comparable to the [Amiga 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500), but with some more modern interfaces.

**Planned Features**:

- 512kB RAM
- SDCard mass storage
- PS/2 keyboard & mouse interface
- Joystick port (C64/Amiga compatible)
- UART serial port (19200 Baud, 8N1)
- VGA video output with 256Ã—128 pixels resolution and a 256 color palette
- Audio output with 16 bit PCM and *maybe* some audio chip synthesis
- Video chip with sprite support
- Graphics DMA and drawing unit similar to the [Amiga Blitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_Chip_Set#Blitter)
