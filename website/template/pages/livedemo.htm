<h2>About</h2>
<p>The black box above is an ANSI terminal emulator with an emulated <i>Ashet</i> connected to it. Just press
  <code>h</code> to see the available options in the boot rom.</p>
<p>Currently, the emulator runs the <a href="https://github.com/MasterQ32/spu-mark-ii/tree/master/soc/firmware">serial
    BIOS</a> of <i>Ashet</i>, as the graphical components are still in development. As soon as the assembler is ported
  to <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a> i will provide the ability to assemble your own code and run it here on the
  website!
