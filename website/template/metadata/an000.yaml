  The SPU Mark II uses quite unique instruction set following a highly orthogonal programming style.
  In contrast to most cpus on the market, the SPU Mark II is a stack machine. This means that all operations move data to or from the stack. This does not mean that this cpu has no registers. There are auxiliary registers like a stack pointer <code>SP</code> or the instruction pointer <code>IP</code>.
