## Overview

- Dispatch multiple IRQ lanes into a single lane
- Acknowledge of IRQs
- Masking of IRQs
- up to 32 IRQs

## Function

The IRQ controller manages up to 32 different IRQ sources that work with level-driven IRQs.
If a source IRQ lane is *low*, the IRQ is assumed to be active. A IRQ becomes inactive when the
source lane will go to *high*.

When an IRQ becomes active, a corresponding bit is set in the `IRQ0` or `IRQ1` register and the output IRQ lane is pulled to *low*.
The output IRQ lane is *low* until all bits in the `IRQ0` and `IRQ1` registers are `0`.

To acknowledge that an IRQ was handled, write a `1` bit into `IRQ0` or `IRQ1` to tell the controller that this interrupt was handled.
If the IRQ was previously active, it is now disabled.

Masking interrupts is supported by writing a `1` bit to `MASK0` or `MASK1`. Interrupts will only become active when the IRQ lane is *low* and the corresponding bit in `MASK0` or `MASK1` is `0`. When the controller is reset, all interrupts are masked.

## Registers

| Offset  | Name  | Size | Access | Description                                |
|---------|-------|------|--------|--------------------------------------------|
| `0x000` | IRQ0  |    2 | R      | Active IRQs 0…15                         |
| `0x002` | IRQ1  |    2 | R      | Active IRQs 16…31                        |
| `0x000` | ACK0  |    2 | W      | Acknowledge IRQs 0…15                    |
| `0x002` | ACK1  |    2 | W      | Acknowledge IRQs 16…31                   |
| `0x004` | MASK0 |    2 | R/W    | Mask IRQs 0…15                           |
| `0x006` | MASK1 |    2 | R/W    | Mask IRQs 16…31                          |

### Active IRQs 0…15

When read, all IRQs between 0 and 15 that were triggered since the last acknowledge are
displayed as `1`. All non-triggered IRQs are `0`.

### Active IRQs 16…31

When read, all IRQs between 16 and 31 that were triggered since the last acknowledge are
displayed as `1`. All non-triggered IRQs are `0`.

### Acknowledge IRQs 0…15

When writing to this register, all bits that are `1` in this register will be acknowledged and reset.

### Acknowledge IRQs 16…31

When writing to this register, all bits that are `1` in this register will be acknowledged and reset.

### Mask IRQs 0…15

When a bit is 1, the corresponding interrupt is masked and will not be able to get active. On controller reset, all interrupts are masked.

### Mask IRQs 16…31

When a bit is 1, the corresponding interrupt is masked and will not be able to get active. On controller reset, all interrupts are masked.
